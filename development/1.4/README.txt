Game Version : 1.3


Hotfix Update:

This version is experimental. It contains the following new updates:

New Graphical Menus
  - Login System Appearance
  - Main Menu Appearance
  - Installation Appearance

New Systematical Loading System
  - All Map data are installed via the user data (per user world data) and modified by the main game during gameplay.
    This would help loading time, handle new information quicker and lower corruption rate.
    Adds new abilities and features added on top of new map data such as new locations/NPC interactions.

New Anticheat Systems

  - Added a new protocol wall to stop user data that may have been corrupted during gameplay or modified to the extent
    that the game lore cannot handle or create.

Debug Mode System
  - Added a verification log file for support and development assistance. If you have any problems with the game, please
    go to the Main Menu (logged in) and go to the settings menu. Type "verify" without the quotation marks to start
    the verification report. Once the report is finished, login into your NXT Studios account in website.com/support
    and submit the .txt file. You will be emailed in respondance to your issue within 48 hours.

Servers
  - Servers are not yet developed due to Command Prompt's limitations however we managed to get a working
    store server to work and change duration and new events.

Modiications (Mods)
  - Given the modder community rights and ability to legally create new modification to extend gameplay better with more
    features and functions to interact with. However there are some limitations of mods that can breach a few policies.
    Please check the Modding tab on the website to see the lists of rules that have to be followed for the mod to be
